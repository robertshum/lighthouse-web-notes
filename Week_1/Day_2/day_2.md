### What I learned

Whenever you are trying to solve a programming problem:

1.) Write pseudo code to solve the problem
2.) Clarify possible input types
3.) Write down any edge cases

Everytime you write code, test it iteratively.
ex: If you just finished a relatively complicated loop, make sure you test it either by debugging or console logging!
