### Functions as Values

A common pattern in programming is to group related data and functions together under a single object. 

It helps make it clear that certain functions are only relevant to a certain object (plus some other benefits that we'll explore later in the course when we dig deeper into Object Oriented Programming).

This pattern is called OBJECT LITERAL PATTERN.  Important in OOP.


### Different Types of tests

1.) Unit

Unit testing is the practice of testing small pieces of code, typically individual functions, alone and isolated. If your test uses some external resource, like the network or a database, it’s not a unit test.


2.) Integration

As the name suggests, in integration testing the idea is to test how parts of the system work together – the integration of the parts.  For example, a unit test for database access code would not talk to a real database, but an integration test would.

You should have fewer integration tests than unit tests. You should mainly use them if you need to test two separate systems together, or if a piece of code is too complex to unit test. 

3.) Functional

Functional testing is also sometimes called E2E testing, or browser testing. They all refer to the same thing.

 Functional tests are on a whole another level. While you can have hundreds of unit tests, you usually want to have only a small amount of functional tests. This is mainly because functional tests can be difficult to write and maintain due to their very high complexity. 

 Functional tests should be used for testing common user interactions. If you would manually test a certain flow of your app in a browser, such as registering an account, you could make that into a functional test.


 ### BDD

 BDD or Behavior Driven Development is a process that encourages you to specify the behaviour of your app in terms of user stories which are broken down into scenarios that can be built and tested.



 ### Recursion

 Dear Diary

 I hate recursion.

 That is all.

 I am still practicing and doing the stretch questions for recursion...

 But my goodness...
